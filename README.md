# Specialized project: Enhancing Privacy Preservation of Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection System
## Introduction
This is the source code for the specialized project developed by my partner and me. Our research is still in progress. 

In this project, I built a Federated Learning (FL) architecture and used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning algorithm for model training on CICIoT2023 dataset. Specifically, my research focused on optimizing training time, model size, or the performance of trained models... Ultimately, the main objective of this project was to integrate privacy preservation measures such as Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption into the model exchange process between clients and the server in the FL architecture, in order to enhance the safety and confidentiality of this process. At the same time, the another goal was to ensure the model’s integrity are preserved after the exchange. 

The source code in this repository includes the entire implementation of our research. If you find it helpful for your own research, feel free to refer to it, but please make sure to cite our source code repo and research paper. Currently, I haven't written a paper for this research yet, but I will update this section once I do in the future.

## Requirements
You can run the programs in the source code on platforms such as Kaggle, Google Colab, or any other platform that supports running with GPU. As for me, I train locally on a WSL2 environment. About environment setup, i followed tutorial from this [repo](https://github.com/mahbub-aumi/tensorflow-cuda-wsl-ubuntu24.04) and [video](https://youtu.be/VOJq98BLjb8?si=fHDSOZ6bB1XfUJlB). You can follow this to set up the environment yourself. In addition, you’ll also need to run the following command to install the required libraries.
```
bash install.sh
```
